implement following methods;
PositionUIElements
CreateInputSwitches
    which requires CalculateSwitchSize
    to then do some more logic to position the switches to line up with what is already implemented in the PositionUIElements method.

Test how the resize eventhandler works after positionUIElements has been implemented

Make Input switches via classes? probably.
Said classes would need:
    bool state; 
    Button buttonToSwitchState;
    EventHandler activateLogic?
